In this case study we had our team construct predictive models to identify the “Flight 
Risk” employees with a sample size of 330,000 employees. The “Flight Risk employees 
are those who are at risk of leaving the company and here at HP “We achieve our 
common objectives through teamwork.”, so this is a very important area for us. Even 
though the turnover rate is hard for a lot of company especially in management, we hate 
to see the good ones go so it is worth the longevity of our staff. 
The questions we are trying to answer, the target variables, are which employees will quit 
the company and what will the managers do with the predictions for the employees they 
supervise? If our team succeeds, they will be highly regarded for helping our company 
change the 20% turnover rate as the 27th largest employer in 2011.
