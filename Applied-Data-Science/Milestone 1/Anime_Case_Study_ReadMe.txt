If you watch anime or read manga you might be able to resonate with this however, even if you do not, I am going to explain everything for you. When you look at the grand scheme of things a show can make money off being on a streaming site, television, publications, etc., these are some ways an anime can make revenue. But today we are looking past that we want to use that as a tool to gain popularity and that will ultimately allow the studio to sell merchandise and make a lot more profits. When you look at top anime like Naruto, One Piece, Dragon Ball are selling tons of merchandise, but they had to get to this spot somehow to gain this popularity. 

The problem I am focusing on is how I could take data and provide the recipe for an anime studio to either pick up a manga for animation or create an original anime. The data set (https://www.kaggle.com/hernan4444/anime-recommendation-database-2020?select=anime.csv)  I have used has great values that I have used to tackle this problem with important columns that can link to the popularity and in urn the revenue or ability to create revenue from a studio, such columns like Score, Episodes, Type, Watching. Completed, Scores 1-10. These are just some of the features that are in the data set that I am using to build my models off that can help giving the studio a reason to pick which type of anime to either create or pick up from a manga.
